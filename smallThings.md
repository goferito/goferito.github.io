### Small Things that make me think I'm on the right direction
*And somehow pretty proud about them*

* My [Bing API Node.js module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-bing-api),
and the 600 downloads a month it has with every new version.

* The few points I got on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1612319/mr-goferito).

* The interest my [Proof of Concept with Google Analytics](https://github.com/goferito/gapoc) got on this [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9857876) question.

* Each of my side projects, some of them opensourced on [my Github account](https://github.com/goferito) and some of them live on [LockShade](//locksha.de).
